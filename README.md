# CNN-Image-classification-on-fashion_mnist-dataset
This case study showcases an image classification project using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Through the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the study explores the intricate process of recognizing and categorizing fashion items.The model architecture begins with a convolutional layer followed by ReLU activation, aiming to extract essential features from the images. Subsequently, a MaxPooling layer is applied to downsample and preserve critical information. The model's structure is then flattened, transitioning into a dense layer with a softmax activation function, producing class probabilities.The study highlights the pivotal role of parameter choices and architecture design in achieving optimal performance. By utilizing the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer, the model fine-tunes its weights to minimize classification errors and enhance accuracy.This case study provides a hands-on demonstration of how to build a CNN model for image classification, emphasizing the key steps in constructing a powerful classifier for real-world fashion recognition tasks.
